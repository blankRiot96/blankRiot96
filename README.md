i like:
- making games (see https://blankriot96.itch.io/)
- watching anime
- playing some games (ULTRAKILL, Hollow Knight, Celeste, Stardew Valley, Burnout Paradise Remastered 2018, NFS MW 2005, Hades)

i dont like vibe coding

* ive dabbled the most in python<br>
  some notable things ive done include:
    - my [modal text editor](<https://github.com/blankRiot96/axedit>) that i made from scratch for python, it's functional! (a bit buggy, though)<br>
    took me 9 months, though i was working on and off on it during that time. tried implementing a few of the vim motions i use in it as well<br>
    plugged in jedi for autocomplete and ruff for the linting<br>
    but i guess most of the work was making a working text editing buffer from scratch, i mean you gotta support a whole lot of things (selecting and deleting text by dragging your mouse, remembering state as you move the cursor around, pasting text somewhere in between, indentation after a new line [this one i kinda gave up on])

    - my [games](https://blankriot96.itch.io/) [a lot to see here, do check em out :)]
    - logging library called [logit](https://github.com/blankRiot96/logit)
    - [mechanical keyboard sound emulator + typing test application](https://github.com/blankRiot96/pyhb)

* ive tried my hand at a few projects in rust
  - done AoC [2015](<https://github.com/blankRiot96/aoc15>) and [2025](<https://github.com/blankRiot96/aoc25>) in rust
  - tried following crafting interpreters but with rust but didnt get really far
  - also tried my hand at making a few games with macroquad
  - recently used embassy-rs and esp-hal to program the pico2 and esp32 boards for my electronics project in uni

* got used to the basic java syntax and C syntax due to uni, i dont need to look things up to write small programs in them
